# Container Support

This pipeline supports containerized execution using **Docker**, which ensures reproducibility and simplifies environment setup.
 
## Using Docker

To run the pipeline with Docker:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker
```

Make sure Docker is installed and the current user has permission to run Docker commands (e.g., add user to `docker` group).

### Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` is provided to build a custom container image:
```bash
docker build -t nf-illumina2lineage .
```

Use your image with:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf -with-docker nf-illumina2lineage
```

---

## Profile Configuration (Optional)
Customize container settings in `nextflow.config`:
```groovy
process.container = 'nf-illumina2lineage'
docker.enabled = true
```

> ğŸ“¦ Using containers is recommended for dependency consistency and reproducibility across systems.
